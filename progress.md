Okay, here is a detailed progress report on the CapConduit platform deployment, summarizing what has been accomplished and outlining the immediate next steps.

Project: CapConduit Call Platform
Date: April 11/12, 2025 (Based on logs)
Current Phase: End of Phase 10 / Beginning of Phase 11

1. Overall Summary / Current Status:

The CapConduit project deployment has successfully completed the setup of the cloud infrastructure, installation and configuration of all core software components, and the full development and testing of the backend API application. The database schema is implemented and populated with sample data. The platform's core business logic for call routing, capping, and accounting resides within the now-functional backend APIs.

The project is now fully prepared to transition into Phase 11: Asterisk Integration, where the telephony engine will be configured to utilize the backend APIs for real-time call processing.

2. Completed Phases & Milestones:

Phase 1-2: Infrastructure Setup & Initial Server Configuration (Complete)
Google Cloud VM (call-platform-vm-debian) provisioned with Debian 12.
Static external IP (34.59.92.30) assigned.
DNS A record for forwarding.realpropbx.com configured pointing to the static IP.
GCP firewall rules created for necessary ports (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, SIP, RTP).
Base OS updated and essential tools installed.
UFW (local firewall) configured and enabled.
Fail2Ban installed and configured for basic security.
Phase 3: Asterisk Installation (Complete)
Asterisk 20 successfully compiled from source.
Dependencies installed.
Modules selected (including PJSIP).
Asterisk installed with sample configurations.
Systemd service configured.
Dedicated asterisk user/group created and permissions set.
Asterisk service is running under the asterisk user.
Phase 4: PostgreSQL Database Installation (Complete)
PostgreSQL installed and service running.
Database (call_platform_db) created.
Application user (call_platform_user) created with a secure password and necessary privileges.
Phase 5: Nginx Web Server Installation (Complete)
Nginx installed and service running.
Verified basic access via IP address.
Phase 6: Python & Flask Environment Setup (Complete)
Python 3, pip, and venv installed on the remote VM.
Project directory (/opt/call_platform) created with correct ownership (sudhanshu:sudhanshu).
Python virtual environment (/opt/call_platform/venv) created and activated.
Required Python libraries (Flask, gunicorn, psycopg2-binary, Flask-Bcrypt, Flask-Login, python-dotenv, decimal) installed via requirements.txt.
Remote .env file created/verified with production database credentials, production FLASK_ENV setting, and a unique SECRET_KEY.
Phase 7: Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration (Complete)
Nginx server block created for forwarding.realpropbx.com.
Configuration set up to proxy requests to the backend Gunicorn application (running on 127.0.0.1:8000).
Site enabled, default site disabled (if applicable).
Nginx configuration tested and service restarted.
Phase 8: Backend Application Service (Gunicorn + Systemd) (Complete)
Systemd service file (call_platform.service) created to manage the Gunicorn process.
Service configured to run as the sudhanshu user, pointing to the correct virtual environment and Flask app (app:app).
Service enabled and started successfully. Verified that Nginx proxies requests correctly to the running Flask app.
Phase 9: Database Schema Design & Implementation (Complete)
Detailed PostgreSQL schema (schema.sql) defined with all necessary tables, columns, relationships, constraints, and indexes.
Schema successfully applied to the call_platform_db database.
Permissions granted to call_platform_user on all application tables and sequences.
Sample data (sample_data.sql) created and successfully loaded into the database, providing a consistent state for testing.
Phase 10: Backend API Development (Complete)
Flask application (app.py) fully developed with necessary structure (DB pool, helpers, logging, extensions).
User Authentication (Login/Register/Logout) implemented and verified.
User-Facing API Endpoints Implemented & Tested:
Campaigns (/api/campaigns, /api/campaigns/<id>, /api/campaigns/<id>/dids)
Targets (/api/targets, /api/targets/<id>)
Forwarding Rules (/api/forwarding_rules, /api/forwarding_rules/<id>)
DIDs (GET /api/dids, POST /api/did_requests)
CDRs (GET /api/cdrs)
Notifications (GET /api/notifications, PUT /api/notifications/<id>/read)
Admin API Endpoints Implemented & Tested:
User Management (/admin/users, /admin/users/<id>)
Balance Adjustment (POST /admin/balance)
DID Request Management (GET /admin/did_requests, PUT /admin/did_requests/<id>/process)
DID Inventory Management (/admin/dids, /admin/dids/<id>)
System Settings (GET /admin/settings, PUT /admin/settings/<key>)
Internal API Endpoints Implemented & Tested:
GET /internal_api/route_info: Core logic for DID lookup, user/campaign/rule identification, cap checking (volume, target total, balance), and target selection implemented.
POST /internal_api/log_cdr: Core logic for inserting CDRs and performing transactional updates to user balance, target counters, and campaign counters implemented.
3. Verification & Testing:

All implemented API endpoints were manually tested using Postman against the local development environment and subsequently verified on the remote deployment.
Testing included successful CRUD operations, error handling (validation, not found, conflicts, authorization), and verification of database state changes (using psql and subsequent API calls).
The core internal APIs were tested by simulating AGI requests via Postman, including successful routing and various rejection scenarios (caps, balance, etc.).
4. Issues Encountered & Resolved:

An initial 405 Method Not Allowed error on POST /login reported during server setup was not reproducible during later local/remote testing and is considered resolved.
An AttributeError in the PUT /api/targets/<id> update logic was identified and fixed.
A database error (updated_at column missing) in the PUT /api/notifications/<id>/read endpoint was identified and fixed by adding the column.
An UnboundLocalError in the exception handling of GET /internal_api/route_info was identified and fixed.
A DID not found error during GET /internal_api/route_info testing was traced to the + sign in the DID parameter being dropped; resolved by URL-encoding the + as %2B in test requests.
A silent transaction rollback issue in POST /internal_api/log_cdr was diagnosed and resolved by adding detailed logging and confirming database state.
5. Immediate Next Steps (Phase 11: Asterisk Integration):

The backend is fully prepared. The next phase focuses entirely on configuring Asterisk to utilize the backend APIs:

Develop routing_lookup.agi Script:
Create the Python script (likely in /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/).
Implement logic to read the incoming DID from AGI environment variables.
Make an HTTP GET request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/internal_api/route_info (using the URL-encoded DID).
Parse the JSON response.
Set Asterisk channel variables based on the parsed response (e.g., ROUTING_STATUS, REJECT_REASON, TARGET_URI_1, TARGET_CONCURRENCY_1, TARGET_URI_2, TARGET_CONCURRENCY_2, etc., MIN_BILLABLE_DURATION, COST_RATE).
Develop cdr_logger.agi Script:
Create the Python script.
Implement logic to read relevant Asterisk channel variables at call hangup (e.g., ${CDR(start)}, ${CDR(answer)}, ${CDR(end)}, ${CDR(duration)}, ${CDR(billsec)}, ${CALLERID(num)}, ${CALLERID(name)}, ${CHANNEL(dnid)}, ${CHANNEL(state)}, ${HANGUPCAUSE}, ${DIALSTATUS}, ${UNIQUEID}, ${LINKEDID}, ${ROUTING_STATUS}, ${REJECT_REASON}, ${EFFECTIVE_TARGET_ID}, ${MIN_BILLABLE_DURATION}, ${COST_RATE}). Note: Some variables need careful setting/retrieval.
Calculate billable_duration based on status and MIN_BILLABLE_DURATION.
Construct the JSON payload for the backend API.
Make an HTTP POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/internal_api/log_cdr.
Develop Asterisk Dialplan (extensions.conf):
Create or modify contexts in /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf.
Define an entry point for incoming calls based on how they arrive (e.g., from a specific PJSIP trunk/endpoint).
In the dialplan:
Answer the call.
Execute the routing_lookup.agi script using the AGI() application.
Use GotoIf() or similar conditionals to check the ROUTING_STATUS variable. If 'reject', play Busy() or Hangup().
If 'proceed', use Set() to potentially parse target lists (if multiple targets) and loop through them.
Inside the loop (or directly if only one target): Use GROUP() and GROUP_COUNT() with the TARGET_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT variable to check concurrency for the specific target group.
If concurrency allows, use Dial() to call the TARGET_URI (e.g., Dial(PJSIP/${TARGET_URI_1}...)). Include appropriate timeout and options (like h flag to ensure hangup handler runs). Capture ${DIALSTATUS}.
Handle different DIALSTATUS outcomes (ANSWER, BUSY, NOANSWER, CONGESTION, CHANUNAVAIL).
Set channel variables needed by cdr_logger.agi (like EFFECTIVE_TARGET_ID if the call connected).
Define the h extension context to unconditionally run cdr_logger.agi.
6. Supporting Files Status:

app.py: Contains the latest, tested Flask backend code.
requirements.txt: Reflects all necessary Python dependencies.
schema.sql: Defines the correct, current database structure.
sample_data.sql: Contains the up-to-date sample dataset reflecting user roles and relationships (ensure password hashes are correctly generated and inserted).
.env (remote): Configured for production database connection and settings.
call_platform.service: Systemd unit file correctly configured.
Nginx configuration (/etc/nginx/sites-available/call_platform): Correctly proxying to the backend.
The project is in a very good state, having completed the complex backend logic and API development. The focus now shifts entirely to the telephony integration layer.
