Progress Report: CapConduit Platform Deployment (v3.0 Update)
Project: CapConduit Call Platform (Redesigned ARA Focus)
Date: April 22, 2025 (Based on last test results)
Current Phase: End of API Layer Testing / Beginning of Asterisk+ARA Integration

1. Overall Summary / Current Status:

The redesigned CapConduit project deployment has successfully completed cloud infrastructure setup, core software installation/configuration, and the full development and testing of the backend API application adhering to the v3.0 schema. The database schema is implemented using Flask-Migrate and populated with sample data. The platform's core business logic resides within the functional Service layer, exposed via tested APIs for Admins, Sellers, and internal processes. Pytest integration tests cover all implemented API endpoints (Auth, Admin, Seller).

The project is now fully prepared to transition into the Asterisk Integration phase, focusing on configuring Asterisk to use Asterisk Realtime Architecture (ARA) with the PostgreSQL backend and implementing the necessary dialplan logic.

2. Completed Phases & Milestones:

Phase 1-2: Infrastructure & Initial Server Config: (Complete) GCP VM, Static IP, DNS, Firewalls (GCP/UFW), Fail2Ban, OS updates.
Phase 3: Asterisk Installation: (Complete) Asterisk 20 compiled, installed, systemd service running.
Phase 4: PostgreSQL Database Installation: (Complete) PostgreSQL installed, DB (call_platform_db) created, User (call_platform_user) created.
Phase 5: Nginx Web Server Installation: (Complete) Nginx installed, basic access verified.
Phase 6: Python & Flask Environment Setup: (Complete) Python 3, venv, project directory (/opt/call_platform or cfap), dependencies installed (requirements.txt), .env configured.
Phase 7: Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration: (Complete) Configured for domain, proxying to backend (Gunicorn).
Phase 8: Backend Application Service (Gunicorn + Systemd): (Complete) Systemd service managing Gunicorn process successfully.
Phase 9: Database Schema Design & Implementation (v3.0 ARA): (Complete)
Detailed PostgreSQL schema (schema_v3.sql) defined with ARA focus (User, Client, pjsip_*, DID, Campaign, campaign_client_settings, Logs).
Flask-Migrate initialized, initial migration generated.
Schema successfully applied via flask db upgrade.
Sample data (sample_data_v3.sql) created and successfully loaded.
Phase 10 (Revised): Backend API & Service Layer Development: (Complete & Tested)
Application Structure: Modular structure with App Factory, Blueprints, Service Layer implemented.
Extensions: SQLAlchemy, Migrate, Bcrypt, LoginManager configured.
Service Layer (app/services/): Business logic implemented for Auth, Users, Clients (incl. PJSIP sync), DIDs, Campaigns (incl. DID/Client linking), Call Routing (data retrieval), Call Logging (CDR insert, counter increment). Commits moved from services to route handlers.
API Layer (app/api/):
Authentication API (/api/auth): Login, Logout, Status endpoints implemented and tested.
Admin API (/api/admin): User Management & Client/PJSIP Management endpoints implemented and tested. Authorization enforced.
Seller API (/api/seller): DID Management, Campaign Management (incl. DID/Client linking) endpoints implemented and tested. Authorization enforced. Log viewing endpoint implemented and tested.
Internal API (/api/internal): Call Logging endpoint (/log_call) implemented (ready for AGI). Routing endpoint (/route_info) conceptually replaced by Asterisk needing to query ARA/DB/simpler API based on dialplan logic. Token security decorator added.
Schemas (app/api/schemas/): Marshmallow schemas implemented for request validation and response serialization for all tested endpoints.
Phase X: Pytest Integration Testing: (Complete for implemented APIs)
conftest.py set up with fixtures for app, client, db (with sample data load), session (transaction rollback), logged-in clients.
Integration tests written and passing for:
Auth API (test_auth_api.py)
Admin User API (test_admin_user_api.py)
Admin Client API (test_admin_client_api.py)
Seller DID API (test_seller_did_api.py)
Seller Campaign API (test_seller_campaign_api.py)
Seller Log API (test_seller_log_api.py)
3. Verification & Testing:

All implemented user-facing (Admin, Seller) and authentication API endpoints have been verified through comprehensive Pytest integration tests, covering success paths, error conditions, validation, and authorization.
Database state consistency maintained via fixtures and transactional tests.
4. Issues Encountered & Resolved:

Multiple Pytest failures related to database transaction isolation, session management, and fixture scope were diagnosed and resolved (iteratively refining conftest.py fixtures and test setup logic, removing commits from services).
Marshmallow schema validation errors (missing fields, partial updates, data_key vs. field name) were identified and corrected in tests and schemas.
Error handling in route handlers improved to map service exceptions to correct HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 vs 403/409).
Minor bugs like missing imports and incorrect variable names in tests were fixed.
5. Immediate Next Steps (Phase 11 Revised: Asterisk + ARA Integration):

The backend API and database are ready. Focus shifts entirely to configuring Asterisk:

Configure Asterisk for ARA:
Set up res_config_pgsql.so in modules.conf.
Configure extconfig.conf to define the PostgreSQL connection details and map ARA table names (pjsip.conf type) to the database tables (pjsip_endpoints, pjsip_aors, pjsip_auths).
Configure sorcery.conf (if using wizards) or ensure res_pjsip.conf loads PJSIP configuration via the realtime backend (psql, config, pjsip.conf). Define necessary transports.
Develop Asterisk Dialplan (extensions.conf):
Create context for incoming calls.
Use dialplan functions/applications to:
Identify incoming DID (${CHANNEL(dnid)}).
Look up associated User/Campaign (requires DB query via func_odbc or potentially a very simple internal API call).
Fetch eligible CampaignClientSettings for the Campaign (DB query/simple API call), ordered by strategy.
Loop through eligible client settings.
Check total_calls_allowed vs current_total_calls from fetched data.
Check concurrency using GROUP() and GROUP_COUNT(ccs-{setting_id}) against max_concurrency from fetched data.
If checks pass, execute Dial(PJSIP/{client_identifier},${dial_timeout_seconds},...). Asterisk uses ARA to find the endpoint details. Store the ccs_id (CampaignClientSetting ID) of the attempted target in a channel variable.
Handle DIALSTATUS for failover/fallback based on routing_strategy.
Develop AGI Script (cdr_logger.agi):
Create Python script in /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/.
Read necessary channel variables (timestamps, durations, callerID, DID, UniqueID, LinkedID, DIALSTATUS, hangup cause, and the stored ccs_id of the final dialed target).
Construct JSON payload for the backend logging API.
Make POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/internal/log_call, including the security token header.
Testing: Use Asterisk CLI (core set verbose, pjsip show endpoints, realtime load, dialplan show, channel originate) for step-by-step verification.
