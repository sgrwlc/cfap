# Progress Report: CapConduit Platform Deployment (v3.0 - Post-Refactor)

**Project:** CapConduit Call Platform (Redesigned ARA Focus)
**Date:** April 23, 2025 (Based on completion of refactoring and testing)
**Current Phase:** Ready for Asterisk + ARA Integration

## 1. Overall Summary / Current Status:

The deployment and initial development of the CapConduit v3.0 platform are complete. Following the initial API implementation (Phase 10 Revised), a dedicated refactoring phase (Internal Phases 1-6) was undertaken to address code quality, standardization, and correctness issues.

**The backend application is now fully refactored and verified.** The database schema is stable, sample data is loaded, and the core business logic is implemented in the service layer. Transaction management and error handling have been standardized across the API routes. All integration tests covering the backend API functionality are passing.

The project is now technically sound and ready to proceed with the planned Asterisk integration.

## 2. Completed Phases & Milestones:

*   **Phase 1-8: Infrastructure & Core Software Setup:** (Complete) GCP VM, Networking, Firewall, Fail2Ban, Asterisk, PostgreSQL, Nginx, Python/Flask Env, Gunicorn/Systemd service.
*   **Phase 9: Database Schema Design & Implementation (v3.0 ARA):** (Complete) Schema defined, migrations applied, sample data loaded.
*   **Phase 10 (Revised): Backend API & Service Layer Development:** (Complete) Initial functional implementation of Auth, Admin, Seller, and Internal APIs and services.
*   **Internal Phase 1: Foundation - Configuration & Custom Exceptions:** (Complete) Custom exceptions defined (`app/utils/exceptions.py`), config files reviewed.
*   **Internal Phase 2: Core Logic - Service Layer Refinement:** (Complete) Removed `db.session.commit()` from all relevant service methods. Replaced generic `ValueError` exceptions with specific custom exceptions (`ResourceNotFound`, `ConflictError`, etc.). Removed redundant validation and debug prints.
*   **Internal Phase 3: API Layer - Routes Refinement:** (Complete) Implemented commit/rollback logic in route handlers. Updated routes to catch specific custom exceptions from services. Removed direct database queries from routes (logic moved to services).
*   **Internal Phase 4: API Layer & Core - Schemas, Models, App Refinement:** (Complete) Reviewed and polished schemas, models, app factory, and decorators for consistency. Ensured error handlers align with `abort()`. Addressed legacy SQLAlchemy warnings.
*   **Internal Phase 5: Testing - Fixtures & Test Code Refinement:** (Complete) Refactored `conftest.py`. Removed explicit `session.commit()` from test setup blocks. Aligned all integration tests with refactored app logic. Added missing tests for internal API (`/log_call`). Fixed all test failures.
*   **Internal Phase 6: Cleanup, Documentation & Final Verification:** (Complete) Created root `README.md`. Performed final code cleanup (unused imports, comments). Verified `requirements.txt`. **Confirmed all 101 integration tests pass.**

## 3. Verification & Testing:

*   All backend API endpoints (excluding the intentionally skipped `/api/internal/route_info`) are covered by Pytest integration tests.
*   **Test Suite Status: PASSING** (101 tests passed as of last run).
*   Database state consistency verified through transactional test fixtures.

## 4. Key Issues Addressed During Refactoring:

*   Inconsistent transaction management (commits in services) resolved; commits now handled consistently in routes.
*   Brittle string-based error handling replaced with robust custom exception handling.
*   Direct database queries removed from route handlers, improving separation of concerns.
*   Test setup inconsistencies (explicit commits) resolved, improving test reliability.
*   Debug remnants (`print` statements) removed from application code.
*   Schema definitions and usage reviewed and standardized.
*   Minor bugs and legacy warnings addressed.
*   Missing tests for internal logging API added.

## 5. Immediate Next Steps (Asterisk + ARA Integration):

The focus shifts entirely to configuring and developing the Asterisk components:

1.  **Configure Asterisk for ARA:**
    *   Set up `res_config_pgsql.so` in `modules.conf`.
    *   Configure `extconfig.conf` (DB connection, ARA table mappings: `pjsip.conf` -> `pgsql,...`).
    *   Configure `sorcery.conf` / `res_pjsip.conf` to use the realtime backend for endpoints, AORs, auth. Define transports.
    *   Verify connection and ARA loading via Asterisk CLI (`realtime load pjsip`, `pjsip show endpoints`, etc.).
2.  **Develop Asterisk Dialplan (`extensions.conf`):**
    *   Create incoming call context.
    *   Implement logic to:
        *   Identify DID (`${CHANNEL(dnid)}`).
        *   Query DB (via `func_odbc` or AGI) for User/Campaign/Settings based on DID.
        *   Loop through eligible client settings based on `routing_strategy`.
        *   Check total call caps (`total_calls_allowed` vs `current_total_calls`).
        *   Check concurrency caps (`max_concurrency` vs `GROUP_COUNT`).
        *   Set `GROUP()` for concurrency tracking.
        *   Store attempted `campaign_client_setting_id` in a channel variable.
        *   Execute `Dial(PJSIP/{client_identifier},...)`.
        *   Handle `DIALSTATUS` for logging and potential fallback.
    *   Define `h` extension to trigger logging.
3.  **Develop AGI Script (`cdr_logger.agi`):**
    *   Create Python script in `/var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/`.
    *   Read channel variables (UniqueID, LinkedID, Timestamps, Durations, CallerID, DNID, DIALSTATUS, Hangup Cause, stored `campaign_client_setting_id`, etc.).
    *   Construct JSON payload matching `LogCallRequestSchema`.
    *   Read `INTERNAL_API_TOKEN`.
    *   Make secure POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/internal/log_call`.
    *   Implement robust logging and error handling within the AGI script.
4.  **Testing:** Perform incremental testing of ARA config, dialplan logic, and AGI script execution using Asterisk CLI and test calls.
